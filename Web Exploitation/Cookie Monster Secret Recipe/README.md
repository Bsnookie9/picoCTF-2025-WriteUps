# Description
Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website. As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret. Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe?  
You can access the Cookie Monster [here](http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:60118/) and good luck

# Hints
- Sometimes, the most important information is hidden in plain sight. Have you checked all parts of the webpage?
- Cookies aren't just for eating - they're also used in web technologies!
- Web browsers often have tools that can help you inspect various aspects of a webpage, including things you can't see directly.

# Solution
Let's start by clicking the link which will redirect us to the following webpage:

Now we can enter random items in the username and password fields. We are then prompted with this:

As the title of the challenge mentions, let's inspect the webpage for the cookies. Right click the page and choose `Inpsect`

Click on the `Application` tab at the top and then expand the `Cookies` tab on the left hand side and you'll see this:

After clicking on the cookie and seeing the value, it popped out at me that this is encoded using Base64.

Let's use CyberChef to decode this:
